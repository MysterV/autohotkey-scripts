This repository contains various AutoHotKey scripts that I personally use.

AutoHotKey is a very lightweight and powerful tool for writing macros, scripts, and mapping them to shortcuts.
I use it to
- launch and switch between apps with quick keyboard shortcut sequences (`open_apps_v2`)
- toggle Windows Explorer show/hide hidden and system files (`ExplorerToggleHiddenFiles.ahk`)
- toggle comments on random lines of code in config files with a shortcut (`toggle_line_comments.ahk`)
- remap various keys (`f12_to_f24_remap.ahk`)
- and more!
